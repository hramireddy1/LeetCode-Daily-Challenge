class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        '''
        Sum of A.P
        (n/2)(2a+(n-1)*d)
        If n is odd, there are same number of operations that need to be performed on both sides with one step having 2, two steps having 4 etc to reach the midpoint.
        Ex. 2+4+6+(n-1)/2 => (n^2-1)/4
        If Even,
        Ex. 1+3+5+n/2 => (n^2)/4
        '''
        return n*n//4
